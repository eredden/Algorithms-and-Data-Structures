# The Last Algorithms Course You Will Ever Need

This repository is a public collection of the notes I took while watching the ThePrimeagen's course of the same name. I implemented the algorithms and data structures here using the C programming language as I want to get a better grasp of it anyways, so I figured it would be best to knock out two birds with one stone.

I will not modify this repository to fix bugs or issues as this is meant purely for a record of my learning rather than as a resource for others to use for these algorithms.
