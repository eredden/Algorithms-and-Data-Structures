# The Last Algorithms Course You Will Ever Need

This repository is a public collection of the notes I took while watching the ThePrimeagen's course of the same name. I implemented the algorithms and data structures here using the C programming language as I want to get a better grasp of it anyways, so I figured it would be best to knock out two birds with one stone.

Usually these programs were planned and scripted prior to seeing ThePrimeagen's implementation of the algorithm/data structure, so the code used by ThePrimeagen and by myself here will vary. This is for my own learning as I do not want to flat out memorize the algorithms, but rather understand them for the future.

I will not modify this repository to fix minor bugs or issues as this is meant purely for a record of my learning rather than as a resource for others to use for these algorithms. As I stated above, these programs are not written in the same manner as those in the actual course as C is the programming language of choice.
