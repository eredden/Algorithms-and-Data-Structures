### Alas, the loss of graphs.

Yeah, there is no way in hell that I am doing this section. This is for someone smarter than myself for the time being. Not doing this in C.

If someone with a bit more time on their hands wants to do this, feel free to send a pull request over. I'll check it out. Happily.

### So what's the big idea about graphs, anyways?

Well, they're essentially just a bunch of nodes that point wherever they want. No structure like linked lists, queues, or stacks. Just pointing anywhere, and even to multiple things.

Everything covered thus far in the course is essentially just a graph.

### Do you ever plan on learning about graphs?

Yeah, I do, but not right this second. I intend on coming back to this at a later time.
